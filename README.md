Well hello there, this ctf is a crypto that i found in hack the box, and i said why not give it a go (looked interessting)

after downloading the directory and puting the password, i had 2 files, the first was this python code with the encryption function on it

And the second on was this text message

So i assumed that this text was the encrypted message used by the function above, so first of all i need to understand what does the python code, so i can decrypt the message for the flag
